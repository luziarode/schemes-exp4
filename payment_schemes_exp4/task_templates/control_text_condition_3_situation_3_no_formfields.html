      <p>The payment mechanism is as follows:</p>
      <p>The two workers form a competitive group. That is, the goal of the workers in each round is to put a larger number of
         sliders to the target position within the given time limit than the other worker in the group. The worker who placed
         more sliders in a group is the winner of this round. It does not matter how large the difference actually is, it only
         matters who of the two workers positioned more sliders correctly. In each of the four rounds, the winner of the round
         receives €3. The loser receives €0.30. In case of a tie where both players have the same number of correctly
         positioned sliders, the winner for this round will be randomly determined.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The initial time limit in the first round is 120 seconds. Depending on performance, the time
         budget is reduced or increased in the subsequent round. In particular, for the winner, 6 seconds are added to his
         current time budget. For the loser, 6 seconds are subtracted from his current time budget. See the example for
         illustration.
      </p>
      <p>Example: Worker A places more sliders correctly in round 1 than worker B. His time budget in
         round 2 will be 126 seconds, worker B&rsquo;s time budget will be 114 seconds. In round 2 worker A again places more
         sliders correctly than worker B. His time budget in round 3 will be 132 seconds, worker B&rsquo;s time budget will be
         108 seconds. In round 3, worker A now places fewer sliders correctly than worker B. His time budget in round 4 will be
         126 seconds, worker B&rsquo;s time budget will be 114.
      </p>
      <p>In general, a shorter time budget to work on the task in a round makes it more difficult, and
         a longer time budget makes it less difficult, to correctly place more sliders than the opponent.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Our data containing more than 600 workers show that workers can correctly place about 20
         sliders per round on average within a time limit of 120 seconds. How much a worker can earn per round depends on his
         own performance, the performance of his opponent, and in the event of a tie, a flip of a coin. If both workers in a
         group win two of the four rounds, then each would receive €6.60 (=€3*2+€0.30*2).
      </p>
      <p>The most skilled workers (top 10%) can place about 29 sliders per round on average, while the
         least skilled workers (bottom 10%) can place about 11 sliders per round on average. If a worker wins four rounds in a
         row, then he can earn €12 (=€3*4), while his opponent earns €1.20 (=€0.30*4), a difference of €10.80 after four
         rounds. Note also that both workers know their own and the other worker&rsquo;s performance and payoffs in each round
         and in total.
      </p>
      <p>Note that these calculations do not account for increased or reduced time budgets due to
         winning or losing earlier rounds. This will lead, on average, to larger numbers of sliders compared to the number for
         120 seconds for those with more time, and on average lower numbers of sliders compared to the number for 120 seconds
         for those with less time. Note also that both workers know their own and the other worker&rsquo;s performance and
         payoffs in each round and in total.</p>
