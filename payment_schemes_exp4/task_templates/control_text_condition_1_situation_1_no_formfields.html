      <p>The payment mechanism is as follows:</p>
      <p>Both workers perform the task individually and independently. The time limit per round to work on the sliders is 120
         seconds. For each correctly positioned slider within the time limit per round, workers receive €0.03. Additionally,
         they also receive €1 each round for participating in the task. Their payment per round can be summarized as €1 +
         €0.03 &times; (Number of sliders).
      </p>
      <p>Our data containing more than 600 workers show that workers can correctly place about 20
         sliders per round on average within a time limit of 120 seconds. An average-skilled worker would, therefore, receive
         €1.60 (=€0.03*20 + €1) per round. The total earnings after four rounds would be €6.40 (=€1.60*4) for an
         average-skilled worker.
      </p>
      <p>The most skilled workers (top 10%) can place about 29 sliders in 120 seconds on average,
         amounting to a payment of €1.87 (=€0.03*29+€1) per round, or €7.48 in total. The least skilled workers (bottom 10%)
         can place about 11 sliders in 120 seconds on average, amounting to a payment of €1.33 (=€0.03*11+€1) per round, or
         €5.32 in total. Thus, the difference in total earnings between the two workers is €2.16 after four rounds if one
         worker is skilled and the other is not. Note also that both workers know their own and the other worker&rsquo;s
         performance and payoffs in each round and in total.
