The most skilled workers (top 10%) can place about 29 sliders in 120 seconds on average, while the least skilled workers (bottom 10%) can place about 11 sliders in 120 seconds on average. Irrespective of their actual performance, workers will receive the flat payment of €1.60 per round, amounting to a payment of €6.40 in total.  Note also that both workers know their own and the other worker’s performance and payoffs in each round and in total.
