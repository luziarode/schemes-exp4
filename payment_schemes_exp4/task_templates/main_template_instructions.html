<p>Please first read all information carefully, and then answer the questions.

In this survey you will be asked to make judgements about different payment mechanisms concerning the following scenario:

</p>
<p>Two workers have to perform a task on a computer. They will be paid according to some payment mechanism, which will be
   described in detail later. The task requires the workers to place a slider in the central position of a slider bar.
   The slider initially appears at the far-left position in the bar. One has to use the mouse to move the slider to the
   target position.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Initial position:</strong>
</p>

<p class="aligncenter">

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Target position:</strong>
</p>

<p class="aligncenter">
    <img src="{{ static 'payment_schemes_exp3/img/target.png' }}" height="34">
</p>

<p>The keyboard has been disabled in order to make the task sufficiently challenging. The task consists of 48 sliders to
   be correctly placed. Placing 48 sliders within a time limit (described later) is called a round. The task is
   repeated for <strong><em>four</em></strong> rounds. The actual screen the workers have seen is like the following.
